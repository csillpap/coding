			<h2>The Border Terrier</h2>
			<img id="borderterrier" src="images/borderterrier.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="Border Terrier">
			<p>BORDER TERRIERS HAVE A WEATHER RESISTANT COAT WITH A HARD, WIRY OUTERCOAT AND SOFT UNDERCOAT THAT REPELS MOST DIRT.</p>
			<p>As its name suggests, the Border has its origin on either side of the Cheviot Hills which form the Border country, and may be regarded as one of the oldest kinds of terriers in Great Britain.</p>
			<p>Border farmers, shepherds, and sportsmen for generations preserved a particular strain of Border that was a purely "working terrier," expertly trained at following fox tirelessly in all-weather environments to protect stock.</p>

			<h2>The Norfolk Terrier</h2>
			<img id="norfolkterrier" src="images/norfolkterrier.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="Norfolk Terrier">
			<p>THE NORFOLK TERRIER IS A GAME AND HARDY LITTLE DOG ORIGINALLY BRED TO GO TO GROUND AFTER VERMIN AND CATCH A FOX</p>
			<p>The Norfolk Terrier is small and sturdy, alert and fearless, with sporting instincts and an even temperament. Good natured and gregarious, the Norfolk has proved adaptable under a wide variety of conditions.</p>
			<p>In England at the turn of the century, working terriers from stables in Cambridge, Market Harborough, and Norwich, were used by Frank Roughrider Jones to develop a breed recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1932 as the Norwich Terrier.</p>
